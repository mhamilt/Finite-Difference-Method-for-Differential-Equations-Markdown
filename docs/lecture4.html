<h1 id="strings">Strings</h1>
<p>This chapter introduces the analysis of continuous systems. The case of a taut string will be considered firts, described by the one-dimensional wave equation. While simple, this equation serves as a model for various other systems, including wave propagation in acoustic tubes, and is generally regarded as the first-ever example of a partial differential equation. Outside of its historical importance, the wave equation can be approached by a vast amount of analytical and numerical techniques. Exact solutions exists in the form of travelling wavefronts (the D’Alembert solution), as well as in the form of standing wave patterns (the modes). Equivalence of these solutions is proven by Fourier theory. Numerically, the solution may be computed using direct numerical simulation, such as finite differences. A discretisation of the D’Alembert solution forms the core of digital waveguide theory, probably the most popular physical modelling technique to date. The solution of the spatial eigenvalue problem using the spatial modes allows to describe the system using a set of uncoupled oscillators, and the numerical techniques used in previous chapters can be directly applied.</p>
<h2 id="equation-of-motion">Equation of motion</h2>
<p>We begin by assuming a lossless, infinitely thin string lying under tension <span class="math inline">\(T(x,t)\)</span> along the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, whose vertical displacement is denoted <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:infinite_string" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:infinite_string">1.1</a>.</p>
<div class="center">

<div class="center">
<figure>
<embed src="Figures/stringElement.pdf" id="fig:infinitesimal_string" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">A infinitesimal section of the infinite string.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We are now going to derive the dynamic equilibrium equations for the element of string depicted in Figure <a href="#fig:infinitesimal_string" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:infinitesimal_string">1.2</a>. For the moment, we are assuming that the displacement <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, the deflection angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and the tension <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> are all functions of the spatial coordinate <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Restricting the attention to the vertical direction, the infinitesimal vertical force <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> acting on the string element is given by the difference of the force at the right end and the force at the left end, hence <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:balance_eq}
df = T(x+dx,t) \sin\left( \theta(x+dx,t) \right) - T(x,t) \sin\left( \theta(x,t) \right) = dx \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(T \sin\theta)\]</span> In dynamic equilibrium, the infinitesimal force is equal to the infinitesimal mass times the acceleration. The infinitesimal mass is given by the volume density <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> times the volume of the string’s element, <span class="math inline">\(dm = ds \rho A\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the cross section of the string (supposed constant here), and where <span class="math inline">\(ds\)</span> is the infinitesimal arclength, <span class="math inline">\(ds = dx \sqrt{1+(\partial y / \partial x)^2}\)</span>. Hence <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:inf_mass}
df = ds \rho A \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\]</span> We can now eliminate <span class="math inline">\(df\)</span> in <a href="#eq:balance_eq" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:balance_eq">[eq:balance_eq]</a> using <a href="#eq:inf_mass" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:inf_mass">[eq:inf_mass]</a>, to get <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:WEtheta}
\rho A \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}ds = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(T \sin\theta)dx\]</span> What we need now are explicit expressions for the tension <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and the angle <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as a function of the coordinate <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. From Figure <a href="#fig:infinitesimal_string" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:infinitesimal_string">1.2</a>, the angle is obtained geometrically as <span class="math display">\[\tan\theta = \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \quad \rightarrow \quad \sin\theta = \frac{\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}}{\sqrt{1 + (\frac{\partial y}{\partial x})^2}}\]</span> In the limit of small displacements, both the deflection angle and the displacement are small, so that <span class="math inline">\(\sin \theta \approx \partial y / \partial x\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(dx \approx ds\)</span>. One may also assume that, under such conditions, the tension is uniform, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(T(x,t)=T_0\)</span>. Thus, using these in <a href="#eq:WEtheta" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEtheta">[eq:WEtheta]</a> yields <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:WE}
 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\]</span> where we have conveniently defined the wave velocity <span class="math inline">\(c = \sqrt{T_0 /\rho A}\)</span>,</p>
<p>This is an example of a <em>partial differential equation</em> (often abbreviated as PDE). Such equations involve <em>partial</em> derivatives, and relate the rate of change in time of a given quantity (here, displacement), to its spatial variation. Equation <a href="#eq:WE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WE">[eq:WE]</a> is often referred to as the <em>simple wave equation</em>, or just as <em>the wave equation</em>. One first observation about the wave equation is that acceleration is proportional to the second spatial derivative. Remember that the second spatial derivative is a measure of the curvature of the function: hence, if the curvature is positive at a given location along the string, then force is pointing upward, and if the curvature is negative, then the force is pointing downward. We are now going to introduce some of the standard techniques for the solution of equations such as <a href="#eq:WE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WE">[eq:WE]</a>.</p>
<h2 id="solutions-to-the-1d-wave-equation">Solutions to the 1D wave equation</h2>
<p><em>Separation of variables</em> is among the techniques often employed in the analysis of PDEs. For that, we assume that <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:sepVar}
y(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\]</span> Although there is no specific reason why a solution would have this form, we will assume that this is the case, and we will check at the end whether the solution obtained via separation is actually meaningful. Inserting <a href="#eq:sepVar" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:sepVar">[eq:sepVar]</a> into <a href="#eq:WE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WE">[eq:WE]</a>, and dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(XT\)</span>, one gets <span class="math display">\[\frac{T^{\prime\prime}}{T} = c^2 \frac{X^{\prime\prime}}{X}\]</span> Note that, in the equation above, primes indicate derivatives with respect to the function’s own argument (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.) Notice also that the left-hand side depends only on <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, and the right-hand side depends only on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: hence, we may conveniently write</p>
<div class="subnumcases">
<p><span id="eq:TXsyst" label="eq:TXsyst">[eq:TXsyst]</span> = s^2 <span id="eq:TXsyst1" label="eq:TXsyst1">[eq:TXsyst1]</span><br />
c^2 = s^2 <span id="eq:TXsyst2" label="eq:TXsyst2">[eq:TXsyst2]</span></p>
</div>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is a constant that does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. The interest of using this system is that the two equations are now in the form of <em>ordinary differential equations</em> (ODE) of the kind already encountered whilst studying the oscillator. We can then solve <a href="#eq:TXsyst1" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:TXsyst1">[eq:TXsyst1]</a> using the exponential technique. This gives <span class="math display">\[T(t) = A_+ e^{st} + A_- e^{-st}, \quad A_+,A_- \in \mathbb{C}\]</span> Clearly, for this solution to be oscillating and not exponentially growing or decaying one must set <span class="math inline">\(s \in j\mathbb{R}\)</span> and, in fact, one may define <span class="math display">\[s = j \omega, \quad \omega \in \mathbb{R}\]</span> We are now in the position of interpreting <a href="#eq:TXsyst1" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:TXsyst1">[eq:TXsyst1]</a>: this is just the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator in time, with radian frequency given by <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>. The fact that the temporal component oscillates at such frequency ensures that the spatial component is also oscillating: this is encaspsulated in <a href="#eq:TXsyst" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:TXsyst">[eq:TXsyst]</a>. This results in the <em>dispersion relation</em> for the wave equation: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:DispRelWECnt}
\omega = c \gamma,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the spatial frequency, measured in rad/m, and called the <em>wavenumber</em>. The solution to <a href="#eq:TXsyst2" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:TXsyst2">[eq:TXsyst2]</a> is obtained analogously. One has <span class="math display">\[X(x) = B_+ e^{j\gamma x} + B_- e^{-j\gamma x}, \quad B_+,B_- \in \mathbb{C}\]</span> Thus, inserting these in <a href="#eq:sepVar" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:sepVar">[eq:sepVar]</a> gives <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:genSolWE}
y(x,t) = \left( A_+ e^{j\omega t} + A_- e^{-j\omega t}\right)\left( B_+ e^{j\gamma x} + B_- e^{-j\gamma x}\right)\]</span> We remark two things: the first, is that the solution <span class="math inline">\(y(x,t)\)</span> is now expressed as a combination of complex-valued functions. The second, is that such combination depends on four arbitrary constants <span class="math inline">\(A_+,A_-,B_+,B_-\)</span>. We make the observation that these constant can be adjusted so that the general solution <a href="#eq:genSolWE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:genSolWE">[eq:genSolWE]</a> satisfies the <em>initial conditions</em> in time, plus the <em>boundary conditions</em> at the string’s ends. We will come back to these conditions later. For the moment, we will assume that the solution <a href="#eq:genSolWE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:genSolWE">[eq:genSolWE]</a> exists for all times, and that the string’s domain is the entire real axis (so that the boundaries are located at <span class="math inline">\(\pm \infty\)</span>): in this case, the four constants are completely arbitrary, and we may use them to construct <em>real</em> solutions.</p>

</figure>
<p>Under some arbitrary choice of the four constants in <a href="#eq:genSolWE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:genSolWE">[eq:genSolWE]</a>, one gets <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:SttoTr}
y(x,t) = \cos (\omega t )\cos (\gamma x )\]</span> You may think of this function as a standing wave pattern that extends across the whole <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. You may notice that, at the locations given by <span class="math inline">\(x = (2n+1)\pi /2 \gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n\in\mathbb Z\)</span>, the solution is always zero: these are the <em>nodes</em> of the standing wave. On the other hand, at the locations given by <span class="math inline">\(x = n\pi/\gamma\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n\in\mathbb Z\)</span>, the solution reaches its maximum amplitude (<span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>) at the times <span class="math inline">\(t = m\pi/\omega\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m\in\mathbb Z\)</span>, see also Figure <a href="#fig:travStd" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:travStd">1.3</a>. The distance between two maxima is then <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 2\pi / \gamma\)</span>: this distance is called the <em>wavelength</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is called the <span class="math inline">\(\emph{wavenumber}\)</span> (i.e. it is the spatial radian frequency). Using basic trigonometric identities, one may re-write <a href="#eq:SttoTr" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:SttoTr">[eq:SttoTr]</a> as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:SumTrav}
y(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\cos (\omega t + \gamma x) + \cos (\omega t - \gamma x ) \right)\]</span> Now, the term <span class="math inline">\(\cos (\omega t + \gamma x)\)</span> is a cosine function <em>travelling to the left</em>; the term <span class="math inline">\(\cos (\omega t - \gamma x )\)</span> is a cosine function <em>travelling to the right</em>, see also Figure <a href="#fig:travStd" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:travStd">1.3</a>. The waves are travelling with speed <span class="math inline">\(\pm c=\pm\sqrt{T_0/ \rho A}\)</span>. Why are these travelling waves? Just think of the points of constant phase: these are <span class="math inline">\(\omega t \pm \gamma x = \text{constant}\)</span>. Deriving the expression above one obtains <span class="math display">\[v_\phi = \frac{dx}{dt} = \pm \frac{\omega}{\gamma} = \pm c\]</span> The velocity of constant phase, indicated here as <span class="math inline">\(v_\phi\)</span>, is called the <em>phase velocity</em>. The absolute value of the phase velocity is given by <span class="math inline">\(|\omega/\gamma|\)</span>, and for the simple wave equation such ratio is always equal to <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<p>The passage from <a href="#eq:SttoTr" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:SttoTr">[eq:SttoTr]</a> to <a href="#eq:SumTrav" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:SumTrav">[eq:SumTrav]</a>, explained in terms of trigonometry, bears in fact some consequences from a physical point of view: we showed that a standing wave can be written as the sum of two travelling waves going opposite directions.</p>

<p>The converse is also true. Starting again from Equation <a href="#eq:genSolWE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:genSolWE">[eq:genSolWE]</a>, we may arrange the four arbitrary constants so to obtain <span class="math display">\[y(x,t) = \cos(\omega t - \gamma x)\]</span> This is of course the expression of a cosine travelling to the right with phase velocity <span class="math inline">\(v_\phi = c\)</span>. Using again appropriate trigonometric identities, one has <span class="math display">\[y(x,t) = \cos(\omega t)\cos(\gamma x) + \sin(\omega t)\sin(\gamma x)\]</span> and, of course, this expression indicates that we can write the travelling cosine as the sum of two standing waves, see also Figure <a href="#fig:stdTrav" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:stdTrav">1.4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-travelling-wave-solutions-for-yxt-for-the-1d-wave-equation">General travelling wave solutions for <span class="math inline">\(y(x,t)\)</span> for the 1D wave equation</h3>
<p>The simple wave equation allows solutions that have a more general character than the sinusoidal solutions found so far. First, rewrite the wave equation as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:WEfac}
\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} - c  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)\left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + c  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right) y(x,t) = 0\]</span> Second, we are now performing a change of variables. Hence, we are mapping <span class="math inline">\((x,t) \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\((\eta,\zeta) \in \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[\eta = x + ct, \qquad  \zeta = x - ct.\]</span> We are then using the chain rule to take partial derivatives in <a href="#eq:WEfac" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEfac">[eq:WEfac]</a>. Thus</p>
<div class="subequations">
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} &amp;= \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t}\frac{\partial }{\partial \eta} + \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t}\frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta} = c \frac{\partial }{\partial \eta} - c \frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta} \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} &amp;= \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x}\frac{\partial }{\partial \eta} + \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial x}\frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta} = \frac{\partial }{\partial \eta} + \frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta} \end{aligned}\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Using these into <a href="#eq:WEfac" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEfac">[eq:WEfac]</a> gives the following PDE <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2y}{\partial \eta \partial \zeta}  = 0\]</span> Hence, direct integration gives <span class="math display">\[y(\eta,\zeta) = f(\eta) + g(\zeta)\]</span> or, <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:Dalem}
y(x,t) = f(x+ct) + g(x-ct)\]</span> In view of the discussion in the previous sections, you will recognise that <span class="math inline">\(f,g\)</span> have the form of a leftward and rightward travelling wave, respectively. Notice that this result is more general than the sinusoidal solutions of the previous section: here, <span class="math inline">\(f,g\)</span> are <em>any</em> function of <span class="math inline">\(x+ct\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x-ct\)</span>. Examples of functions that are solution to the wave equation: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:WEsolsEx}
y_1(x,t) = e^{(x-ct)}, \,\,\, y_2(x,t) = \log \left( (x+ct)^2 \right), \,\,\, y_3(x,t) =  ...\]</span> Beware that nonlinear combinations (i.e. products) of <span class="math inline">\(f,g\)</span> are not, in general, solutions. Examples of functions that <em>are not</em> solutions to the wave equation: <span class="math display">\[p_1(x,t) = (x-ct)e^{x+ct}, \,\,\, p_2(x,t) = \log \left( (x+ct)^2 \right)\left(\cos(x-ct)\right)^2, \,\,\, p_3(x,t) = ...\]</span> This property of allowing solutions such as <span class="math inline">\(f(x+ct)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x-ct)\)</span> is not valid for other one dimensional PDEs in acoustics: the simple wave equation is special in this sense. This equation describes the motion of ideal strings, and also the vibration of air columns with cilindrical geometry. These forms for <span class="math inline">\(f,g\)</span> were first derived by D’Alembert in 1747, and are known as <em>D’Alembert solutions</em>. They are at the core of early physical modelling techniques based around <em>digital waveguides</em>.</p>
<p>Important note. Although function such as those in <a href="#eq:WEsolsEx" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEsolsEx">[eq:WEsolsEx]</a> solve the wave equation mathematically, they might not be "energy-compatible". In practice, not only does a function need to solve <a href="#eq:WE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WE">[eq:WE]</a>, but it also must comply with some requirements at the string’s ends, the boundary conditions. This aspect will become clearer as we progress through the course.</p>
<h2 id="energy-for-the-1d-wave-equation">Energy for the 1D wave equation</h2>
<p>In order to derive energy expressions for the string, we might try to relate the work done by the tension forces to stretch an infinitesimal element of string, as that in Figure <a href="#fig:infinitesimal_string" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:infinitesimal_string">1.2</a>. The corresponding change in potential energy is given by the stretching in the deformed configuration, minus the stretching in the undeformed configuration, times the tension <span class="math inline">\(T_0\)</span>. Hence <span class="math display">\[dE_p =  T_0 (ds-dx) =  T_0  \left(\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2} - 1 \right)dx\]</span> To first order, one has <span class="math display">\[dE_p \approx \frac{T_0}{2}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2 dx\]</span> From Newtonian physics of conservative systems, we know that sum of the changes of potential and kinetic energies is equal to zero, hence <span class="math display">\[dE_k + dE_p = 0\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(dE_k = \frac{\rho A}{2} \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 dx\)</span>. Integrating this last expression between <span class="math inline">\(x_l\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_r\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(x_l&lt;x_r\)</span>) gives <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnBal}
E_k + E_p = \int_{x_l}^{x_r} \frac{\rho A}{2} \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)^2 dx + \int_{x_l}^{x_r} \frac{T_0}{2} \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2 dx = E\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the total energy (a constant). Notice that the total energy is a function of time only.</p>
<h3 id="energy-balance-for-an-infinitely-long-string">Energy balance for an infinitely long string</h3>
<p>We can try to check whether the energy balance equation <a href="#eq:EnBal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBal">[eq:EnBal]</a> actually provides a consistent definition for the total energy. To that extent, take a time derivative of <a href="#eq:EnBal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBal">[eq:EnBal]</a>. This is <span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt}\left( E_k + E_p \right) = \int_{x_l}^{x_r} \rho A \left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) dx + \int_{x_l}^{x_r} T_0 \left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t\partial x}\right)\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right) dx = 0\]</span> For the moment, we are only concerned with infinitely longs strings, so that <span class="math inline">\(x_l = -\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_r = \infty\)</span>. Using integration by parts to calculate the second integral, one can rewrite the energy balance as <span class="math display">\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \rho A \left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) dx - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} T_0 \left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\right)\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) dx = - T_0 \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)\bigg|_{-\infty}^{\infty}\]</span> We make the assumption that the right-hand side vanishes. (In fact, this puts some limitations on the form of the solutions to the wave equation. What can you say about the functions in <a href="#eq:WEsolsEx" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEsolsEx">[eq:WEsolsEx]</a>?)</p>
<p>Collecting the common factor in the integrals, we finally get <span class="math display">\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[ \rho A \left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\right) - T_0 \left(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}\right) \right]\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right) dx  = 0\]</span> Comparing this last expression with <a href="#eq:WE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WE">[eq:WE]</a>, we see that the integrand is in fact identically zero. Thus, we observe that the energy expressions in <a href="#eq:EnBal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBal">[eq:EnBal]</a> are consistent with the wave equation, provided that the solutions behave as required at the boundary of the domain.</p>
<h2 id="initial-conditions">Initial Conditions</h2>
<p>We are now going to try to prove that, regardless of the approach we wish to adopt to describe the solutions, we are going to end up with the same solution. In order to see this, we are now going to introduce <em>initial conditions</em> on the string, such that we may assume that the string is at rest for <span class="math inline">\(t&lt;0\)</span>, and that some prescribed initial conditions are given at <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span>. For simplicity, only displacement initial conditions will be studied here, so that <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:ICs}
y(x,0) = y_0(x), \qquad \frac{\partial y(x,0)}{\partial t} = v_0(x).\]</span> For simplicity, only displacement initial conditions will be studied in the following, for which <span class="math inline">\(v_0(x) = 0\)</span>. We are now going to solve the wave equation, with these initial conditions, using both the D’Alembert solution, and the solution in terms of sinusoids (in fact, a Fourier method).</p>
<h3 id="dalembert-solution-with-prescribed-initial-conditions">D’Alembert solution with prescribed initial conditions</h3>
<p>Using <a href="#eq:Dalem" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:Dalem">[eq:Dalem]</a> into <a href="#eq:ICs" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ICs">[eq:ICs]</a> gives <span class="math display">\[f(x)+g(x) = y_0(x), \qquad f^\prime(x) - g^\prime(x) = 0\]</span> Integrating the second condition, one gets <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = g(x)\)</span>, and using this into the first condition one gets <span class="math display">\[f(x)=g(x)=\frac{y_0(x)}{2}\]</span> so that <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:Tr}
y(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}\left( y_0(x-ct) + y_0(x+ct)\right)\]</span> The meaning of this last equation is that any initial displacement will split into two travelling wavefronts, of amplitude equal to one half that of the initial displacement. (If the initial velocity is not identically zero, the solution is a little more involved, but it is again separable into two travelling wavefronts.)</p>
<h3 id="fourier-solution-with-prescribed-initial-conditions">Fourier solution with prescribed initial conditions</h3>
<p>If instead we wish to use the sinusoidal representation for the solution, note that the most general form is given by the Fourier integral <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:FTy}
y(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat y(\gamma,t) e^{j\gamma x}d\gamma\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\hat y(\gamma,t)\)</span> is the Fourier transform of <span class="math inline">\(y(x,t)\)</span>, defined as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:yhat}
\hat y(\gamma,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  y(x,t) e^{-j\gamma x}d x\]</span> The meaning of <a href="#eq:FTy" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FTy">[eq:FTy]</a> is that the solution can be represented as a superposition of sine / cosine functions of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma x\)</span>, times an appropriate complex amplitude <span class="math inline">\(\hat y(\gamma,t)\)</span>. The complex amplitude can be calculated by taking a Fourier transform of the kind <a href="#eq:yhat" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:yhat">[eq:yhat]</a> of the wave equation <a href="#eq:WE" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WE">[eq:WE]</a>. This gives <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial^2 \hat y(\gamma,t)}{\partial t^2} = - c^2\gamma^2 \hat y(\gamma,t),\]</span> which is the usual harmonic oscillator equation solved by <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:yhh}
\hat y(\gamma,t) = A_+(\gamma) e^{jc\gamma t} + A_-(\gamma)-e^{-jc\gamma t}\]</span> We can now impose the initial conditions <a href="#eq:ICs" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ICs">[eq:ICs]</a> (transformed in the Fourier domain) <span class="math display">\[\hat y(\gamma,0) = \hat y_0(\gamma), \qquad \frac{\partial \hat y (\gamma,0)}{\partial t} = 0\]</span> which give <span class="math display">\[A_+(\gamma) = A_-(\gamma) = \frac{\hat y_0(\gamma)}{2}\]</span> Using these into <a href="#eq:yhh" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:yhh">[eq:yhh]</a> and that into <a href="#eq:FTy" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FTy">[eq:FTy]</a> gives the solution <span class="math display">\[y(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\hat y_0(\gamma)}{2} \left( e^{-j c\gamma t} + e^{j c\gamma t} \right) e^{j\gamma x} d\gamma\]</span> which may be written as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:FTtoTr}
y(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\hat y_0(\gamma)}{2}  e^{j\gamma (x - c  t)}d\gamma +  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\hat y_0(\gamma)}{2}  e^{j\gamma (x + c  t)}d\gamma  = \frac{1}{2}\left( y_0(x-ct) + y_0(x+ct)\right)\]</span> where the last equality is simply an application of the definition of the Fourier transform as per <a href="#eq:FTy" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FTy">[eq:FTy]</a>. Comparing <a href="#eq:FTtoTr" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FTtoTr">[eq:FTtoTr]</a> with <a href="#eq:Tr" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:Tr">[eq:Tr]</a>, we see that the result is the same. Note as well that, in <a href="#eq:FTtoTr" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FTtoTr">[eq:FTtoTr]</a>, we effectively write the solution as an infinite combination (an integral) of travelling sinusoidal functions of amplitude given by the intial conditions.</p>
<p>The net result of this discussion is that it should not matter how you decide to write out your solution: you should always end up with the same thing once initial conditions are imposed! Note that, so far, we have not yet talked of boundary conditions, as we have assumed that the string is infinite in length. The rest of today’s lecture is to understand how the introduction of bounded domains imposes further restrictions on the nature of the solutions.</p>
<h2 id="sec:WaveEquationsBCs">Energy of a semi-infinite string. Boundary conditions.</h2>
<p>The nature of boundary conditions may be understood from energy arguments. Recall that the energy of the flexible string is <span class="math display">\[E = E_k + E_p = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\rho A}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 dx + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{T_0}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx\]</span> The energy balance is expressed as <span class="math inline">\(dE/dt = 0\)</span>. However, these results are only valid when the string is infinite in length. Suppose now that the string is only defined for <span class="math inline">\(x\geq 0\)</span>. In practice we have introduced a boundary point at <span class="math inline">\(x=0.\)</span> The energy is given by <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnHalf}
E = E_k + E_p = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\rho A}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 dx + \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{T_0}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx\]</span> However, the energy balance is now <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnBal}
\frac{dE}{dt} = - T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x }\Bigg|_{x=0}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t }\Bigg|_{x=0}\]</span> As you can see, the boundary term can now influence the energy balance in such a way as to produce or disspate power! (Note that the energy balance is expressed as the product of a force times a velocity at the boundary point.) One way of ensuring that <span class="math inline">\(dE/dt = 0\)</span> (as per the string of infinite length), is then to require that either the force, or the velocity, is zero at the boundary. Thus, one may set <span class="math display">\[y\big|_{x=0} = 0 \,\,\, \forall t, \,\,\, \text{or } \,\,\, \frac{\partial y}{\partial x }\Bigg|_{x=0} = 0 \,\,\, \forall t\]</span> The first condition corresponds to zero displacement / velocity, and is therefore called <em>fixed</em>, or of <em>Dirichlet</em> type. The second condition corresponds to vanishing force at the boundary, and is called <em>free</em>, as in free of load, or of <em>Neumann</em> type.</p>
<p>The question is, it is not immediately obvious to see why the energy balance should have the form <a href="#eq:EnBal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBal">[eq:EnBal]</a>. The most straightforward way of deriving such energy balance is to start from the equation of motion, multiplied by the velocity, and to integrate over the string’s length. Hence <span class="math display">\[\rho A \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} dx = T_0 \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} dx\]</span> The left-hand side can be expressed as <span class="math display">\[\int_0^{\infty}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} dx = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}\int_0^{\infty} \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)^2 dx\]</span> The right-hand side can be integrated by parts, and written as <span class="math display">\[\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} dx = - T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x }\Bigg|_{x=0}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t }\Bigg|_{x=0} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dt}  \int_0^{\infty}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\right)^2 dx\]</span> Thus, we recover the energy balance <a href="#eq:EnBal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBal">[eq:EnBal]</a> with energy components given by <a href="#eq:EnHalf" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnHalf">[eq:EnHalf]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dalembert-solution-with-prescribed-boundary-condition">D’Alembert solution with prescribed boundary condition</h3>
<p>We now wish to describe the motion on the semi-infinite string using the D’Alembert solution. Consider first a boundary condition of <em>fixed</em> type. Using this condition one gets <span class="math display">\[y(0,t) = f(-ct) + g(ct) = 0, \,\,\, \forall t\]</span> This corresponds to setting <span class="math inline">\(f(-ct) = -g(ct)\)</span>. An interpretation of this result is given in Figure <a href="#fig:DalFixed" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:DalFixed">1.5</a>: essentially, the solution can be thought as the sum of the actual solution, defined for <span class="math inline">\(x\geq 0\)</span>, plus a “ghost” solution defined over <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;0\)</span>. The ghost solution is just the flipped image of the right-travelling wave <span class="math inline">\(f(x-ct)\)</span>. When the actual left-going solution enters the negative <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis, the corresponding flipped ghost solution enters the positive <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis. The net result is that the actual solution gets reflected at the boundary <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> with a sign change.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Figures/FixedBCTravel.png" id="fig:DalFixed" alt="D’Alembert solution with fixed boundary at x=0. Thick black line is the actual solution for x\geq 0.

</figure>
<p>Turning now the attention to the <em>free</em> boundary condition, the mathematical condition here is <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(0,t)=-f^\prime(-ct)+g^\prime(ct) = 0 \,\,\, \forall t\]</span> which can be integrated to give <span class="math inline">\(f(-ct)=g(ct)\)</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="Figures/FreeBCTravel.png" id="fig:DalFree" alt="D’Alembert solution with free boundary at x=0. Thick black line is the actual solution for x\geq 0.

</figure>
<p>This is sketched in Figure <a href="#fig:DalFree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:DalFree">1.6</a>. Here the ghost solution has the same sign as the right-travelling wave, so that at the boundary <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> the slope of the actual solution is zero (there is a stationary point there.)</p>
<h3 id="fourier-solution-with-prescribed-boundary-condition">Fourier solution with prescribed boundary condition</h3>
<p>Suppose now that we wish to describe the solution in terms of Fourier components (i.e. sine and cosine functions.) In analogy to the case developed for the initial conditions, we are now taking a Fourier transform in the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> domain, so that the solution may be represented as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:ytt}
y(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat y(x,\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega\]</span> where the Fourier transform <span class="math inline">\(\hat y(x,\omega)\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:yhattOm}
\hat y(x,\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}  y(x,t) e^{-j\omega t} d t\]</span> (Note that, with a slight abuse of notation, we have identified with the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\hat y\)</span> both the Fourier transform in the <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> domain, in <a href="#eq:yhat" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:yhat">[eq:yhat]</a>, and the Fourier transform in the <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> domain in <a href="#eq:yhattOm" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:yhattOm">[eq:yhattOm]</a>. These are of course distinct functions.) Using the transformed wave equation, we get <span class="math display">\[-\omega^2 \hat y(x,\omega) = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \hat y(x,\omega)}{\partial x^2}\]</span> which is solved, as per usual, by <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:bcss}
\hat y(x,\omega) = B_+(\omega) e^{j\frac{\omega}{c}x} + B_-(\omega) e^{-j\frac{\omega}{c}x}\]</span> Using the fixed boundary condition at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> gives <span class="math inline">\(B_+ = -B_-\)</span> and thus <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:FixedFou1}
\hat y(x,\omega) = 2jB_+(\omega) \sin \frac{\omega x}{c}\]</span> The solution is then given by using this expression in <a href="#eq:ytt" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ytt">[eq:ytt]</a> <span class="math display">\[y(x,t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C_+(\omega) \sin\frac{\omega x}{c} e^{j\omega t} d\omega\]</span> where we defined <span class="math inline">\(C_+ = 2 j B_+/\sqrt{2\pi}\)</span>. Notice that, indeed, we could have taken a Fourier transform in <a href="#eq:ytt" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ytt">[eq:ytt]</a> using <span class="math inline">\(e^{-j \omega t}\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(e^{j \omega t}\)</span>, so that effectively a more general solution is given by <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:FixedFou}
y(x,t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C_+(\omega) \sin\frac{\omega x}{c} e^{j\omega t} d\omega +  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C_-(\omega) \sin\frac{\omega x}{c} e^{-j\omega t} d\omega\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C_+,C_-\)</span> may be determined from the two initial conditions.</p>
<p>Using instead the free boundary condition in <a href="#eq:bcss" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:bcss">[eq:bcss]</a>, we get <span class="math inline">\(B_+ = B_-\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:FreeFou}
\hat y(x,\omega) = 2 B_+(\omega) \cos \frac{\omega x}{c}\]</span> and thus, the general solution is <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:FreeFou}
y(x,t)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} D_+(\omega) \cos\frac{\omega x}{c} e^{j\omega t} d\omega +  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} D_-(\omega) \cos\frac{\omega x}{c} e^{-j\omega t} d\omega\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D_+,D_-\)</span> are again determined by the initial conditions. These meaning of <a href="#eq:FixedFou" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FixedFou">[eq:FixedFou]</a> is that, no matter the time evolution of the solution, the spatial distribution is such that the solution can be written as a linear combination of sine functions (that are always zero at the origin.) On the other hand, a free condition is such that the solution can be expressed as a linear combination of cosine functions, that have zero slope at the origin, as in <a href="#eq:FreeFou" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FreeFou">[eq:FreeFou]</a>.</p>
<h2 id="strings-of-finite-length">Strings of finite length</h2>
<p>The analysis carried out so far is very useful, as we are now ready to analyse the case of a string of finite length. A good place to start, once more, is the energy balance for the string, now defined for <span class="math inline">\(0\leq x \leq L\)</span>. The energy balance is <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnBalFull}
\frac{dE}{dt} = T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x }\Bigg|_{x=L}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t }\Bigg|_{x=L} - T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x }\Bigg|_{x=0}\frac{\partial y}{\partial t }\Bigg|_{x=0}\]</span> The origin of this expression should now be clear to you. The idea is to perform the same mathematical steps that lead to <a href="#eq:EnBal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBal">[eq:EnBal]</a>, but where now the limits of integration are set between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Hence <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnFinite}
E = E_k + E_p = \int_{0}^{L} \frac{\rho A}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 dx + \int_{0}^{L} \frac{T_0}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx\]</span> In order to study the motion of strings of finite length, we may again adopt either the D’Alembert or the Fourier solution. Notice that the boundary conditions are exactly symmetric at the two string’s ends. So, the same interpretation of a fixed or a free boundary can be given at <span class="math inline">\(x=L\)</span>. This idea of deriving boundary conditions from energy analysis is indeed very powerful, and will be used a lot during this course.</p>
<h3 id="sec:BoundWECnt">Boundedness of the solutions</h3>
<p>Given the energy balance <a href="#eq:EnFinite" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnFinite">[eq:EnFinite]</a>, it is immediate to see that <span class="math display">\[\int_0^L \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 \, \mathrm{d}x \leq \frac{2E}{\rho A}, \quad \int_0^L \left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2 \, \mathrm{d}x \leq \frac{2E}{T_0},\]</span> expressing the bounds on the norms of the velocity and the gradient. These are generalisations to the continuous case of the bounds found for the oscillator in Section <a href="#sec:BoundsSHO" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:BoundsSHO">[sec:BoundsSHO]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dalembert-solution-for-strings-of-finite-length">D’Alembert solution for strings of finite length</h3>
<p>Given this interpretation for the boundary conditions, the D’Alembert solution should be pretty obvious to you now: at either end of the string, the right/left travelling wave front gets reflected exactly, with a sign change for a fixed boundary, and without a sign change for a free boundary. The left-going and right-going wavefronts at the time <span class="math inline">\(t=0\)</span> may be determined using <a href="#eq:Tr" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:Tr">[eq:Tr]</a>. There is nothing complicated here. This solution is indeed powerful, both because of its simplicity, and because of the ease of implementation in the digital domain via a digital waveguide appraoch. However, it has the drawback of not being generalisable to other systems (outside of cylindrical air columns).</p>
<h3 id="fourier-solution-for-strings-of-finite-length">Fourier solution for strings of finite length</h3>
<p>On the other hand, the Fourier approach has the advantdge of being, to some extent, universal: you may indeed apply this method to any linear, time-invariant system, in one or more dimenensions. The principle of application of this method has already been illustrated in the previous examples of strings of infinite length. Suppose now that the string is fixed at both ends, so that <span class="math display">\[y(0,t) = y(L,t) = 0\]</span> We have already derived the expression for the solution with a fixed boundary at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>. This has led to <a href="#eq:FixedFou1" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FixedFou1">[eq:FixedFou1]</a>. Now, from <a href="#eq:FixedFou1" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FixedFou1">[eq:FixedFou1]</a>, given that the string is fixed at <span class="math inline">\(x=L\)</span>, we should also have <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:omeM}
y(L,t) = 0 \implies \sin \frac{\omega L}{c} = 0 \implies \omega = \omega_m = \frac{\pi m c}{L}, \,\,\, m \in \mathbb{N}\]</span> This is a very important result: what <a href="#eq:omeM" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:omeM">[eq:omeM]</a> is saying is that only certain vibrational frequencies are now allowed, those that multiples of the fundamental frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1 = \pi c / L\)</span>. In other words, the effect of finite string length is to select only a discrete set of frequencies <span class="math inline">\(\{ \omega_m \}\)</span>, whilst in strings of infinite length sinusoidal components of any frequency may be found. This has a consequence on how we express the general solution <a href="#eq:FixedFou" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FixedFou">[eq:FixedFou]</a>. Instead of integrals, now we have <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:modal}
y(x,t) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty } \left( C_+^{(m)} \sin \frac{\omega_m x}{c} e^{j \omega_m t} +  C_-^{(m)} \sin \frac{\omega_m x}{c} e^{-j \omega_m t} \right)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(C_+^{(m)},C_-^{(m)}\)</span> are determined from the initial conditions. We call the expansion <a href="#eq:modal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:modal">[eq:modal]</a> a <em>modal</em> expansion. The modes of the system are defined as a set comprising both the <em>modal frequencies</em> <span class="math inline">\(\{ \omega_m \}\)</span> and the <em>modal shapes</em> <span class="math inline">\(\{\sin \frac{\omega_m x}{c}\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The form of <a href="#eq:modal" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:modal">[eq:modal]</a> should be familiar to you: consider one point along the string, say <span class="math inline">\(x_p\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:Modes}
y(x_p,t) = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty } \left( \bar C_+^{(m,x_p)} e^{j \omega_m t} +  \bar C_-^{(m,x_p)}  e^{-j \omega_m t} \right)\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\bar C_+^{(m,x_p)} = C_+^{(m)} \sin \frac{\omega_m x_p}{c}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\bar C_-^{(m,x_p)} = C_-^{(m)} \sin \frac{\omega_m x_p}{c}\)</span>. But <a href="#eq:Modes" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:Modes">[eq:Modes]</a> is just the sum of harmonic oscillators, whose amplitude is proportional to the value of the modal shape at the selected point. Hence, the vibration at each point alont the string can be thought of as resulting from the sum of harmonic oscillators, of increasing frequency. The oscillators are “transparent” to each other, meaning that the vibration of each oscillator is not influenced by what any other oscillator is doing. A picture of the modal shapes is given in Figure <a href="#fig:fixfix" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:fixfix">1.7</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>If we decide to impose different boundary conditions at either end point, we end up with different expressions for the modal shapes. Consider for instance the case of a <em>free-free</em> string. We already know that a free end at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> on a semi-infite string results in a general solution of the kind <a href="#eq:FreeFou" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FreeFou">[eq:FreeFou]</a>. We now bring in a second boundary point at <span class="math inline">\(x=L\)</span>, with the requirement that <span class="math inline">\(\partial y / \partial x (L,t) = 0\)</span>. This condition gives <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\cos\frac{\omega x}{c}\Bigg|_{x=L} = - \frac{\omega}{c} \sin \frac{\omega L}{c} = 0 \implies \omega = \omega_m = \frac{\pi m c}{L}, \,\,\, m \in \mathbb{N}_0\]</span> These are the same frequencies that we obtained for the fixed-fixed case, with the small difference that here the solution for <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> (zero frequency) gives rise to a modal shape that is <em>not</em> identically zero: this special mode is a free-body mode, in which the string does not oscillate but “floats” is space. (This is physically meaningful, as the string is not attached at the ends and is therefore able to float. In reality, though, this kind of boundary condition cannot be realised, as the tension in the string arises from being attached at both boundaries. If either one of the boundaries is not fixed, then no tension is applied.) A picture of the modal shapes is given in Figure <a href="#fig:freefree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:freefree">1.8</a>.</p>
<p>Another case of interest is the fixed-free case. Again, we should start from the expression of the semi-infinite string with a fixed boundary at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, <a href="#eq:FixedFou" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:FixedFou">[eq:FixedFou]</a>. Now, the second condition to impose is <span class="math inline">\(\partial y / \partial x (L,0) = 0\)</span>, which is <span class="math display">\[\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\sin\frac{\omega x}{c}\Bigg|_{x=L} =  \frac{\omega}{c} \cos \frac{\omega L}{c} = 0 \implies \omega = \omega_m = \frac{\pi (2m-1) c}{2L}, \,\,\, m \in \mathbb{N}\]</span> The frequencies are now odd multiples of the fundamental frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1 = \pi c / 2 L\)</span>, which is one octave lower than the fundamental frequencies of the fixed-fixed and free-free cases. A picture of the modal shapes is given in Figure <a href="#fig:fixfree" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:fixfree">1.9</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The last case of interest, the free-fixed case, is left to you as an exercise. The interpretation of the modal expansion is that, for <em>any</em> initial conditions, the final solution can be expressed as a combination of standing waves, of shape and frequency determined by the boundary conditions. Of course, as we have discussed at some length previously, the net result of such combination of standing modes need not be a standing wave: in fact, it will almost always be a travelling wavefront.</p>

<p>The boundary conditions given above are a useful idealisation. The study conducted so far has allowed us to understand the general physical properties of ideal strings. Of course, real musical strings do not behave in this idealised manner. More realistic string models will be taken into account later in the course, when we include stiffness effects (i.e. when we consider the effects of finite string thickness.) Here, we want to analyse the effect of introducing more realistic boundary conditions at one of the string’s end. Let us consider a fixed-free string and suppose that, at the right boundary, we attach some kind of bridge. A useful model for a bridge is that of a mass-spring system: in practice, the bridge is characterised by a mass <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, a stiffness <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and a loss parameter <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. This kind of boundary condition is sketched in Figure <a href="#fig:impBc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:impBc">1.10</a>.</p>
<p>We want to set up the equation of motion of the mass-spring system. Of course, this is in the form of an oscillator equation, i.e. <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:ImpBSc}
m \frac{d^2 z}{dt^2} = - k z - R \frac{d z}{dt} + f(t)\]</span> Here, the displacement <span class="math inline">\(z(t)\)</span> of the bridge is equal to the displacement of the string’s end, so that <span class="math inline">\(z(t) = y(L,t)\)</span> (the bridge is attached to the string at all times!) The external force <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is the force exterted by the string’s end onto the mass. What is this force? We know this expression from the energy balance <a href="#eq:EnBalFull" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBalFull">[eq:EnBalFull]</a>: <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:ft}
f(t) = - T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(L,t)\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the minus sign is here due to the fact that this is the force of that the string exerts <em>onto</em> the mass. In practice, the boundary displacement <span class="math inline">\(z(t)\)</span> now satisfies the differential equation <a href="#eq:ImpBSc" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ImpBSc">[eq:ImpBSc]</a>, and is not simply prescribed. The question is whether the string plus mass-spring system satisfies an energy balance. This is, if course, the case. Considering that the string is fixed at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>, the boundary term at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> vanishes in <a href="#eq:EnBalFull" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBalFull">[eq:EnBalFull]</a>. All we need to do is to check what happens at <span class="math inline">\(x=L\)</span>. To that extent, take a product of <a href="#eq:ImpBSc" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ImpBSc">[eq:ImpBSc]</a> with <span class="math inline">\(dz/dt\)</span>. This gives <span class="math display">\[m \frac{d^2 z}{dt^2}\frac{d z}{dt} = - k z\frac{d z}{dt} - R \left(\frac{d z}{dt}\right)^2 + f(t)\frac{d z}{dt}\]</span> Using the usual energy identities, we get <span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt}\left( \underbrace{\frac{m}{2} \left(\frac{d z}{dt}\right)^2}_{e_k} + \underbrace{\frac{k z^2}{2}}_{e_p} \right) = - R \left(\frac{d z}{dt}\right)^2 + f(t)\frac{d z}{dt}\]</span> We are now taking the sum of <a href="#eq:EnBalImp" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBalImp">[eq:EnBalImp]</a> with <a href="#eq:EnBalFull" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:EnBalFull">[eq:EnBalFull]</a>, to get <span class="math display">\[\frac{dE}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}\left(E_k + E_p + e_k + e_p \right) = - R \left(\frac{d z}{dt}\right)^2 + f(t)\frac{d z}{dt} + T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{x=L} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \Bigg|_{x=L}\]</span> Of course, remembering the definitions of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> in <a href="#eq:ft" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ft">[eq:ft]</a> and of <span class="math inline">\(z(t)\)</span>, one has <span class="math display">\[f(t)\frac{d z}{dt} + T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}\Bigg|_{x=L} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\]</span> and thus, the energy balance for this kind of boundary is <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnBalImp}
\frac{dE}{dt} = - R \left(\frac{d z}{dt}\right)^2 \leq 0\]</span> This is a comforting (and expected!) result. The energy in the system is decreasing because of the loss at the boundary, and is perfectly conserved if <span class="math inline">\(R=0\)</span> (conservative boundary.) The added mass and spring are energy-storing devices, and therefore the total energy now includes the corresponding kinetic and potential energies. A boundary condition such as <a href="#eq:ImpBSc" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ImpBSc">[eq:ImpBSc]</a> has a nonzero, finite impedance, as opposed to the fixed condition (infinite impedance), or the free condition (zero impedance). We can now analyse the effect of various cases.</p>

<p>Case a): <span class="math inline">\(m=0,R=0\)</span>. Here, we are assuming that the mass and loss parameter of the bridge are very small compared to the stiffness. The boundary condition <a href="#eq:ImpBSc" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ImpBSc">[eq:ImpBSc]</a> in this case is <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:imp1}
k z = f(t)\]</span> We want to determine the modal frequencies and modal shapes of the string under this condition. Remembering that <span class="math inline">\(z(t) = y(L,t)\)</span>, and remembering that the modal shapes for fixed boundary at <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> are in the form of <span class="math inline">\(\sin \frac{\omega x}{c}\)</span>, condition <a href="#eq:imp1" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:imp1">[eq:imp1]</a> gives <span class="math display">\[k y(L,t) = -T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(L,0) \implies k \sin \frac{\omega L}{c} = - T_0 \frac{\omega}{c} \cos \frac{\omega L}{c}\]</span> First, two sanity checks. It is easy to see that, for <span class="math inline">\(k=0\)</span>, we get back to the fixed-free case (<span class="math inline">\(\cos \frac{\omega L}{c} = 0\)</span>) analysed before. Also, if <span class="math inline">\(k\rightarrow \infty\)</span>, we obtain again the fixed-fixed condition (<span class="math inline">\(\sin \frac{\omega L}{c} = 0\)</span>). If <span class="math inline">\(k \neq 0\)</span>, the boundary condition gives <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:bc1}
\tan \frac{\omega L}{c} = - \frac{T_0}{ck}\omega\]</span> This is a trascendental equation, that can be solved using numerical root-finding algorithms. A picture of the solution to this equation is given in Figure <a href="#fig:trasc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:trasc">1.11</a>. Notice that, when <span class="math inline">\(\omega \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, the equation reduces to <span class="math inline">\(\tan\frac{\omega L}{c}\rightarrow \infty\)</span> which is solved by <span class="math inline">\(\omega_m = (2m-1)\pi c / 2L\)</span>, i.e. the same frequencies as the fixed-free case. In practice, at high frequencies the effects of stiffness are negligible compared to the case of free boundary. The most affected modes are at low frequencies!</p>
<p>Case b): <span class="math inline">\(k=0,R=0\)</span>. A second case of interest is given by a bridge where the mass is much larger than the stiffness and loss parameter. The boundary condition <a href="#eq:ImpBSc" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ImpBSc">[eq:ImpBSc]</a> in this case is <span class="math display">\[m \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} = f(t)\]</span> Thus, <span class="math display">\[-m \omega^2 y(L,t) = -T_0 \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(L,0) \implies m  \sin \frac{\omega L}{c} =   \frac{T_0}{c\omega} \cos \frac{\omega L}{c}\]</span> Another sanity check here indicates that, when <span class="math inline">\(m=0\)</span> we obtain again the solution to the fixed-free boundary; when <span class="math inline">\(m\rightarrow \infty\)</span> we obtain again the frequencies of the fixed-fixed boundary (as expected! If the mass is really small / large, the boundary is effectively free / fixed.) For all other cases, one has <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:bc2}
\tan \frac{\omega L}{c} = \frac{T_0}{c m}\omega^{-1}\]</span> which is another trascendental equation solvable via numerical root-finding procedures. Notice again that, for large frequencies, we obtain <span class="math inline">\(\tan\frac{\omega L}{c}= 0\)</span> which is solved by <span class="math inline">\(\omega_m = m\pi c / L\)</span>: at high frequencies the bridge appears rigid! See also Figure <a href="#fig:trasc" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:trasc">1.11</a>.</p>
<h2 id="viscous-loss">Viscous Loss</h2>
<p>Conservative wave propagation is in practice never realised, at least over time scales of the order of seconds (i.e. the timescale of a musical signal, for example.) Thus, we are now going to study the effects that losses have on wave propagation. In analogy with the oscillator, we may introduce a loss factor propotional to the velocity of the string. Hence <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:WEloss}
\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} - 2\sigma   \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\]</span> Note that the energy analysis here leads to <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:EnBalWE}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{0}^{L} \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \right)^2 dx + \int_{0}^{L} \frac{c^2}{2}\left( \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \right)^2 dx \right) = -2\sigma \int_0^L \left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}\right)^2 dx,\]</span> and hence energy is not increasing whenever <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \geq 0\)</span>, which will be assumed in the remainder.</p>
<p>A first thing to notice here, is that the D’Alembert solution ceases to be valid when <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \neq 0\)</span>. Thus, we cannot use such solution in the current analysis. The other tools that we developed previously though (separation of variables, analysis in the Fourier domain) are still valid, and we are going to make use of them now. What we could do, is to try to separate the solution into components depending only on time and space, i.e. <span class="math display">\[y(x,t) = T(t)X(x)\]</span> We could then use this expression into <a href="#eq:WEloss" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEloss">[eq:WEloss]</a>, and follow the same steps as we did for the wave equation without loss, in last week’s lecture. The net result is that we end up with <span class="math display">\[y(x,t) = T(t)X(x) = \left(A_+ e^{st} + A_- e^{-st} \right)\left(B_+ e^{j\gamma x} + B_- e^{-j \gamma x} \right)\]</span> where the four complex constants <span class="math inline">\(A_+,A_-,B_+,B_-\)</span> are arbitrary so long as initial and boundary conditions are not specified. Above, <span class="math inline">\(s = -\sigma + j \omega\)</span>. In practice, the solution is a combination of typical terms such as <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:ddp}
y(x,t) = e^{st}e^{j\gamma x}\]</span> In actual fact, when analysing PDEs such as <a href="#eq:WEloss" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEloss">[eq:WEloss]</a>, we may immediately try to use solutions such as <a href="#eq:ddp" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ddp">[eq:ddp]</a>. We make an <em>assumption</em> that solutions have that form, and then characterise the solutions according to the particular relationship between the frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and wavenumber <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. Such assumption in textbooks is often called an <em>ansatz</em> (a german word.)</p>
<p>The use of solutions such as <a href="#eq:ddp" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:ddp">[eq:ddp]</a> in PDEs is one of the tools you should understand and master in this course. The reason why we want to use such expression for the solution, as noted, is to find a relation between <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> known as the <em>dispersion relation</em>. Doing so for <a href="#eq:WEloss" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:WEloss">[eq:WEloss]</a> gives <span class="math display">\[s^2 + 2 \sigma s + c^2 \gamma^2 = 0 \implies s = - \sigma \pm j \sqrt{c^2\gamma^2 - \sigma^2}\]</span> Thus, the dispersion relation is <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:dispRelLoss}
\omega = \sqrt{c^2\gamma^2 - \sigma^2}\]</span> Of course, when <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=0\)</span> one recovers the dispersion of the simple wave equation <span class="math inline">\(\omega = c\gamma\)</span>. The interesting fact about <a href="#eq:dispRelLoss" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:dispRelLoss">[eq:dispRelLoss]</a> is that now the system is <em>dispersive</em>. Dispersion is a property of vibratory system in which waves at different frequencies travel at different speeds. The wave equation without loss is <em>not</em> dispersive, because all waves travel at the same speed <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. The wave equation with loss, on the other hand, has dispersion. Consider a simple harmonic solution <span class="math display">\[y(x,t) = \cos(\omega t - \gamma x)\]</span> Using the definition of <em>phase velocity</em> <span class="math inline">\(v_\phi\)</span> (encountered in last week’s lecture), one has <span class="math display">\[v_\phi = \frac{\omega}{\gamma} = \frac{\sqrt{c^2 \gamma^2 - \sigma^2}}{\gamma} \approx c - \frac{\sigma^2}{2c\gamma^2} = c \left(1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{2(\omega^2+\sigma^2)} \right)\]</span> and thus we see that the phase velocity now depends on the frequency of the wave! In particular, waves of high frequency are non-dispersive, as the limit of the dispersion relation as <span class="math inline">\(\omega \rightarrow \infty\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="dispersion.-group-velocity">Dispersion. Group Velocity</h2>
<p>The concept of dispersion is fairly important for our study on wave propagation, because it brings about the question of what we mean by <em>wave velocity</em>. For a non-dispersive system such as the simple lossless wave equation, the answer is trivial as all wavefronts travel with the same speed <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. This allows to write solutions in the form given by D’Alembert. However, the introduction of a viscous loss term has the consequence of introducing a frequency-dependent phase velocity. So, what is the speed of a wave?</p>
<p>It is convenient, in dispersive systems, to not consider sines or cosines in isolation, but to consider <em>groups</em> of them. This is because, from Fourier theory, a disturbance may always be decomposed onto a linear combination of sines and cosines. Thus, let such disturbance be <span class="math display">\[\label{eq:gvv}
y(x,t) = \sum_{i=1}^N \cos(\omega_i t - \gamma_i x + \phi_i)\]</span> (here, for simplicity, we are considering a discrete sum, though we may replace the sum with a Fourier integral as seen before.) The form of <span class="math inline">\(y(x,t)\)</span> is that of a group of waves. We are also making the assumption that such group is centered around some reference frequency <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0\)</span> and wavenumber <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span>, so that effectively <span class="math display">\[\omega_i = \omega_0 + \delta \omega_i, \quad \gamma_i = \gamma_0 + \delta \gamma_i, \quad i \in [1,N]\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\delta \omega_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\delta \gamma_i\)</span> being small. Thus, the change in phase <span class="math inline">\(dP_i\)</span> for a small displacement <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> in the time <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span> for each of the waves is given by <span class="math display">\[dP_i = \omega_i dt - \gamma_i dx\]</span> Now, this is the very important point: if the group moves “without changing in shape too much” then <em>all</em> the phases in the sum <a href="#eq:gvv" data-reference-type="eqref" data-reference="eq:gvv">[eq:gvv]</a> have changed by the same amount. Thus we set <span class="math inline">\(dP_i - dP_j \approx 0\)</span>, or <span class="math display">\[(\omega_i-\omega_j)dt - (\gamma_i-\gamma_j) \approx 0 \implies \frac{dx}{dt} \approx \frac{\delta \omega}{\delta \gamma}\]</span> Thus, is convient to define the <em>group velocity</em> <span class="math display">\[v_{g} = \frac{d \omega }{d \gamma}\]</span> that has the interpretation of the velocity of a group of waves, centered around some mean values <span class="math inline">\(\omega_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_0\)</span>, that travel with mostly the same speed, so that a packet of such waves retains its shape whilst travelling through the medium.</p>
